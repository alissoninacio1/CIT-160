            El Nayar is a town located in the state of Nayarit. Both words make reference to an ancient indian ruler who lived in one of the largest mountain range in Mexico. Huicholes, as said in spanish or Wix√°rikas (written in its own language), are the people who are a remnant of the ancient native americans of that region. We can see them on streets in Mexico, or in the downton cities on the south-west part of the country. The name means <i>"son of God who are in heaven and in the sun".</i>
